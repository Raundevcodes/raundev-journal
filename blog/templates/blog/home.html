        <h2>From Static to Dynamic: My Developer Journey So Far</h2>
        <p class="post-date">Posted on August 30, 2025</p>
        <p>It started with a password generator.
A simple desktop app built with Python and Tkinter — my first taste of GUI design, logic, and user interaction. It wasn’t flashy, but it worked. And more importantly, I built it.
Then came the website.
Static, elegant, and full of style.
Crafted with HTML and CSS, sprinkled with JavaScript to add just enough sparkle. It was my digital canvas — a place to showcase, experiment, and express.
But static wasn’t enough.
I wanted more than pages. I wanted power.
So I began learning Django — a framework that felt intimidating at first, but quickly revealed its elegance. I set up my first project, created a blog app, built models, views, and templates. I debugged errors, ran migrations, and watched my first post appear on the homepage.
Now, I’m building a blog that will integrate with my existing site — and eventually, replace it.
The goal is to rebuild the entire website using Django, transforming it from a static showcase into a dynamic, database-driven experience.
It’s not just about code anymore.
It’s about growth.
About learning how to build something that lives, breathes, and evolves.
This is my journey — from desktop to web, from static to dynamic.
And it’s only just beginning.</p>
